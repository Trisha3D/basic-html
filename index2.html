                Grocery Shopping:
            </strong>
        </h2>
        <em>
            Grocery shopping is a regular activity that involves selecting and purchasing 
            food and household items, often guided by a list or budget to meet daily or weekly
            needs. It can be a practical way to plan meals, save money by choosing seasonal or 
            discounted products, and explore new ingredients for cooking. Whether done at a 
            supermarket, local market, or online, it plays a key role in maintaining a healthy 
            and organized lifestyle.

                Cooking:
            </strong>
        </h2>
        <em>
            Cooking is the art and science of preparing food by combining ingredients and 
            applying heat or other techniques to create meals that nourish and delight. It can 
            be a creative outlet, a way to express care for others, and a practical skill that
            promotes healthier eating and self-sufficiency. Whether you're following a recipe or 
            improvising with what's on hand, cooking brings together flavors, cultures, and traditions 
            in a deeply personal and often joyful experience.
