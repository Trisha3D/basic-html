                Grocery Shopping:
            </strong>
        </h2>
        <em>
            Grocery shopping is a regular activity that involves selecting and purchasing 
            food and household items, often guided by a list or budget to meet daily or weekly
            needs. It can be a practical way to plan meals, save money by choosing seasonal or 
            discounted products, and explore new ingredients for cooking. Whether done at a 
            supermarket, local market, or online, it plays a key role in maintaining a healthy 
            and organized lifestyle.
